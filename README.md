# LazyPredator
## Genetic programming, negative selection, genetic drift.

**LazyPredator** is a framework for genetic programming — a type of genetic algorithm — with an emphasis on negative selection, genetic drift, and relative tournament-based fitness.

It is written in C++ and structured as a “header only” library. Just copy (or git clone) its source files and include `LazyPredator.h` in your code.

There is a bit of a [LazyPredator development notebook](https://cwreynolds.github.io/LazyPredator/). 

**LazyPredator** was initially used to optimize programs to perform procedural texture synthesis based on the [TexSyn](https://cwreynolds.github.io/TexSyn/) library. That combination of LazyPredator and TexSyn was a large component of the research project described in the paper [Coevolution of Camouflage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11793) published at the Artificial Life Conference 2023, in Sapporo, Japan, then in a poster at SIGGRAPH 2023 in Los Angeles, USA.
