# LazyPredator
**Genetic programming, negative selection, genetic drift.**

LazyPredator is a framework for genetic programming—a type of genetic algorithm—with an emphasis on negative selection, genetic drift, and relative tournament-based fitness.

It is still being built, so is in a not-yet-usable state.

There is a bit of a [LazyPredator development notebook](https://cwreynolds.github.io/LazyPredator/). 

LazyPredator will initially be used to optimize programs to perform procedural texture synthesis based on the [TexSyn](https://cwreynolds.github.io/TexSyn/) library.
